I fixed yesterday with the <em>Bonaventure's</em> men that they should lie underneath this ledge tomorrow sennight, if the sea be smooth, and take us off on the spring-tide. At midnight is their hour, and I said eight days on, to give thy leg a week wherewith to strengthen. I thought to make for St. Malo, and leave thee at the <em>Ã‰peron d'Or</em> with old Chauvelais, where thou couldst learn to patter French until these evil times have blown by.

I know the castle; it is not two miles</p></div> </div>
