Says the Lander to his men,  
Get your grummets on the pin,  
  There's a blue light burning out at sea.  
The windward anchors creep,  
And the Gauger's fast asleep,  
  And the kegs are bobbing one, two, three,  
               Says the Lander:  
  The kegs are bobbing one, two, three.  

But the bold Preventive man  
Primes the powder in his pan  
  And cries to the Posse, Follow me.  
We will take this smuggling gang,  
And those that fight shall hang  
  Dingle dangle from the execution tree,  
               Says the Gauger:  
Dingle dangle with the weary moon to see.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
